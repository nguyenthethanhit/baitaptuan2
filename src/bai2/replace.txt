Now thanh will talk about Exception Handling. 
Here in this program, thanh have kept it simple so nothing much to worry about here, hothanhver, thanh do take the name from the user. 
The array thanh use to store the name is of size 30. What will happen if user enters a string that is more than 30 in length? This would result in a buffer overflow. This may crash your program right away or produce unexpected results
To avoid this either thanh can write a function that would get a string from the stdin one by one and stops if Enter is pressed or if string is more than 30 OR thanh can use the inbuilt function known as fgets
Thanks!

replace we by thanh
